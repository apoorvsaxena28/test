Banks today are heavily adopting GenAI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve customer service, compliance research, internal knowledge access, and employee productivity.
However, current RAG systems fail to meet the critical requirements of a regulated banking environment due to four major gaps:

1. One-size-fits-all answers are unusable in a bank

A CEO, a Relationship Manager, a Junior Analyst, a Customer, and a Compliance Officer all have different needs and access rights, but current RAG systems retrieve the same documents and the same depth of information for everyone.

This leads to:

Information overload for business users

Lack of precision for analysts

Poor explainability for customers

Risk of employees seeing too much or too little information

2. High risk of regulatory and data leakage

Banks hold highly sensitive data:

Customer PII

Account balances

Transaction histories

Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)

Internal risk models and thresholds

Current RAG pipelines often send large chunks of documents to the LLM before permissions are checked, meaning:

The AI model sees sensitive data even if the user should not.

This violates strict banking regulations: FFIEC, GLBA, GDPR, RBI privacy, internal risk controls, and audit requirements.

3. Token and compute costs are huge for banks

Bank documents are long, complex, and filled with tables, legal text, and multi-lingual content.
Traditional RAG retrieves full raw text every time, causing:

High token usage

Increased compute cost

Higher latency

Slower customer-facing response times

At large scale, this becomes extremely expensive.

4. Lack of persona-awareness leads to compliance incidents

Different roles in a bank require different content handling rules:

Compliance analyst → needs all raw logs

Retail customer → should only see simplified factual summaries

Auditor → needs full traceability

Executive → needs high-level insights

Developer → needs raw JSON or log lines

Without persona-awareness, RAG systems cannot satisfy these varied requirements.

🧠 Proposed Solution — Persona-Adaptive Multi-Resolution RAG (PAMR-RAG)

A secure, intelligent retrieval system designed specifically for banks.

PAMR-RAG introduces three innovations that make RAG safe, role-aware, and cost-efficient for financial institutions.

1. Automatic Persona Detection

For each query, the system identifies the user’s role/persona using:

Query intent

User’s department, job role, and RBAC profile

Historical interaction patterns

Contextual metadata (channel, device, customer vs employee)

Persona examples in banking:

Retail customer

Premier / Wealth customer

Relationship Manager (RM)

Loan Underwriter

Compliance Officer

Fraud Investigator

Risk Analyst

Auditor

Customer Support L1/L2

Executive

This ensures the system understands who is asking, not just what they’re asking.

2. Context Compression Pyramid (CCP)

Every bank document (policy, loan file, statement, regulation, report) is stored in three synchronized layers:

R₀ – Raw Layer

Full, unabridged content: contracts, KYC docs, logs, statements, regulations

R₁ – Distilled Layer

Summaries, highlights, extracted tables, compliance notes

R₂ – Symbolic Layer

Key facts, decision rules, risk flags, knowledge graph nodes

The system selects the appropriate layer(s) based on persona:

Persona	Context Delivered
Executive	Symbolic + distilled
Analyst	Distilled + raw
RM	Summary + actionable facts
Auditor	All layers + traceability
Customer	Simplified symbolic view only
Developer	Raw logs or JSON only

This ensures each user gets the right depth, not too much, not too little.

3. Pre-LLM Permission Filtering (Zero Leakage Layer)

Before anything goes to the LLM:

Customer PII

Internal threshold values

Transaction IDs

Proprietary algorithms

SAR-related fields

Restricted audit data
are removed based on persona and bank access controls.

This is the crucial difference from existing RAG systems.

AI never sees what the user is not allowed to see.

This prevents:

Accidental leakage

Prompt injection-based exposure

Regulator violations

Insider access breaches

🌟 Benefits to the Bank
1. Zero data leakage to GenAI

You guarantee that sensitive banking data is never sent to an LLM unless explicitly allowed.

2. 30–70% lower token usage

By serving distilled or symbolic layers to most personas, token usage drops significantly.

3. Faster responses

Smaller context → faster AI → better customer & employee experience.

4. Regulatory compliance

Pre-LLM filtering aligns with:

GLBA

FFIEC

GDPR

SOC2

RBI Data Localization & Privacy Guidelines

Internal bank audit rules

5. Tailored intelligence for every role

A compliance officer gets raw logs; a customer gets clean, simple explanations — from the same underlying data.

6. Enterprise-wide scalability

A single RAG engine can safely serve:

Customers

Employees

Risk teams

Auditors

Senior leadership

Each receiving different versions of the truth, personalized and permission-aligned.

💼 In one sentence:

Your solution makes GenAI finally safe, role-aware, and cost-efficient for banking — by controlling who sees what and at what level of detail, before the AI even starts thinking.
